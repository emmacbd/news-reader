# News Reader

## About The Project

This was the final Take Home Project for Turing School of Software and Design's Front End Engineering program. The goal for this project was to create a New York Times inspired news feed that allows users to view and filter NYT articles by section. Users should be able to navigate the app with ease and be able to use this app on desktop, tablet, or mobile device. The suggested total time to build the app was 8 hours.

### Minimum Viable Product required:
* A list of articles
* A “detailed” view for each article (as opposed to summary/list view)
* Articles in the list must link to the detailed article view you create
* Some sort of search, filter, OR sort


## Technologies
* React | React Router
* GraphQL
* Javascript
* HTML
* CSS

## Set Up Instructions

#### Running it Locally
1. Clone this repo to your local machine
2. `cd ` into `news-reader`
3. Then, run `npm install `from your command line. Do not run `npm audit fix --force`
4. After you run npm install inside of your copy of this repo, run:
`npm start`
This command runs the app in the development mode locally so that you can view and use the application in your browser.
```
You can now view News Reader in the browser.
